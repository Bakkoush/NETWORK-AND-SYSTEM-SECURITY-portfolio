 Master Summary — Network and System Security Portfolio (Weeks 2–9)

Welcome to my Security Portfolio.
This repository contains eight in-depth, professionally structured weekly labs covering a wide range of cybersecurity, penetration testing, cryptography, malware analysis, AI security, and binary triage topics.

Each week has its own fully written portfolio entry in a dedicated Markdown file (e.g., week2.md, week3.md, … week9.md).
Please consult those files for the complete technical write-ups, diagrams, analysis, and reflections.

 Week 2 — Hybrid Encryption & Secure Client–Server Communication

Introduces hybrid cryptography through RSA key exchange paired with AES encryption.
Covers confidentiality, secure key distribution, encryption/decryption workflows, and building a secure client–server system.

 Full write-up: see week2.md

 Week 3 — Authentication and Access Control

Covers password-strength evaluation, hashing (SHA-256, salting, peppering), bcrypt, dictionary attacks, and TOTP-based 2FA.
Implements a full authentication workflow with secure password storage and multi-factor authentication.

 Full write-up: see week3.md

 Week 4 — Malicious Software

Explores malware classifications, simulated malware behaviour, evasion techniques, ransomware logic, worms, keyloggers, and mitigation strategies.
Focuses on analysing malicious activity and relating it to defensive mechanisms.

 Full write-up: see week4.md

 Week 5 — Web Security

Uses automated vulnerability scanning with Wapiti to assess misconfigurations and missing security headers.
Analyses CSP, HSTS, MIME types, clickjacking protection, and aligns findings with OWASP standards.

 Full write-up: see week5.md

 Week 6 — Binary Analysis & Symbolic Execution (Binary Analysis Focus)

Implements static binary triage using a custom Python tool.
Extracts hashes, strings, PE headers, imported APIs, IOCs, and basic YARA scanning.
Forms the foundation for deeper malware analysis and reverse engineering.

 Full write-up: see week6.md

 Week 7 — Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking

Builds a Python-based penetration testing toolkit performing domain intelligence, HTTP header recon, port scanning, and Nmap service enumeration.
Emphasises ethical considerations and legal constraints in reconnaissance.

 Full write-up: see week7.md

 Week 9 — GenAI Security

Analyses adversarial prompting, prompt injection, LLM drift, data-extraction attempts, behaviour cloning, and cross-model comparisons.
Evaluates real security risks in large language models and demonstrates how LLMs can be manipulated or misled.

 Full write-up: see week9.md

 How to Navigate This Portfolio

Each weekly portfolio entry is located in its own file:

week2.md
week3.md
week4.md
week5.md
week6.md
week7.md
week9.md


Open each weekX.md file to read the detailed portfolio for that week.
Each file contains:

Full explanations

Code walkthroughs

Architecture diagrams

Security analysis

Reflections


The best way to look at each week.md files would be selecting code for each of them due to the diagram not appearing correctly on the first option.

I have used chatGPT to help me structure my portfolio.
